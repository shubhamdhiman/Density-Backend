# ðŸš€ Strapi Density Backend Server
## Every time log in and enter New Entries and create New API TOKEN.
## It will work till the tab of the strapi which is deployed is open. Once it's closed, everything gets refreshed.
## Maybe I made some configuration issues. I saw some discussion pages where the same issue was there but no solution was provided.
